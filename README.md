# NLP for Law and Economics Scholars - A Very Short Intro

## Overview of Session
This set of slide provides a concise introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for scholars in law and economics. 
The session is tailored to help lawyers and economists understand how NLP can assist in empirical legal studies and navigate challenges in the field.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the session, participants will be able to:
1. Understand the relevance of NLP in law and economics research.
2. Explain the concepts of bag-of-words and word embedding.
3. Identify the opportunities and risks associated with large language models (LLMs) in legal research.

## Outline

### 1. Introduction to Law and Economics Scholarship 
- Overview of law and economics as an interdisciplinary field.

### 2. From Theory to Empirical Analysis 
- Transitioning from theoretical frameworks to data-driven approaches.
- Types of empirical analysis in law and economics:
  - Descriptive
  - Correlational
  - Causal

### 3. Text as Data Approach 

#### a. From Text to Data
- **Conceptual Introduction**:  
  - Turning unstructured legal texts into structured data.
  - Applications in analyzing contracts, court opinions, and regulations.
  
- **Techniques**:
  1. **Bag of Words**:  
     - Explanation of tokenization and frequency-based analysis.
     - Practical example using simulated data.
  2. **Word Embedding**:  
     - Introduction to semantic representation (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
     - How embeddings capture contextual meaning in legal documents.

#### b. Empirical Legal Analysis Using NLP 
- **Descriptive Analysis**:  
  - Identifying trends and patterns in legal texts.
- **Correlational Analysis**:  
  - Measuring relationships between legal text features and economic outcomes.
- **Causal Analysis**:  
  - Exploring causal effects in legal decision-making using NLP-based data.

#### c. Large Language Models (LLMs) in Legal Studies
- **Opportunities**:
- **Risks and Limitations**

## Required Libraries and Tools
- **NLTK**: Tokenization and text preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: Bag-of-words implementation and simple modeling.
- **Plotly**: Visualization of textual data trends and analysis.
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical modeling for correlational and causal analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.

## Hands-On Activity
Participants will analyze a simulated dataset of sales contracts to:
1. Tokenize and preprocess the text using **NLTK**.
2. Create a bag-of-words representation with **scikit-learn**.
3. Generate and visualize word embeddings.
4. Perform a simple descriptive and correlational analysis.
